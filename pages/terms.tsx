            </GenericSectionSubtitle>
            <GenericParagraph>
              DataHarvest.lol is a query editor for the browser that allows
              users to build and run their own queries to retrieve League of
              Legends data from our proprietary database of games. Users may
              request the addition of their games to the database, and
              DataHarvest periodically adds games to the database using the
              match history of random ranked players. The Site's purpose is to
              allow users to query for data they couldn't otherwise get directly
              from other more direct stats websites, and to be able to get
              historical data in the long run (we try to very rarely delete
              games from our database).
